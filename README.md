# concurrency

This repository features a C++ project focused on multithreading, concurrency, and synchronization techniques. It showcases mechanisms such as basic mutexes with locks, semaphores, barriers and condition variables.

The application is based on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and was build on a template.
